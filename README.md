This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python and the Turtle graphics library. In Pong, two players control paddles on the screen to bounce a ball back and forth. The objective is to prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to score points by allowing the ball to pass the opponent's paddle

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 22.
